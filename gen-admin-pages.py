"""Regenerate the real per-section admin pages under /admin/<section>/.

Why this exists: admin/index.html is one page with every panel in the DOM,
shown/hidden by admin.js's showPanel(). Pressing the browser's Back button
inside it just leaves /admin entirely, since nothing ever changed the URL.
admin.js now does real client-side routing (pushState per panel, a
popstate listener, PANEL_PATH/routeFromLocation) - but that routing only
has something to land on for a hard refresh or a direct/shared link if a
real file exists at that path. This script writes those files.

Unlike gen-product-pages.py, nothing here is crawled or needs per-page
<head> content baked in (admin is behind auth and disallowed in
robots.txt) - every generated file is a byte-for-byte copy of
admin/index.html. admin.js reads location.pathname itself to decide which
panel to show; the file's job is only to exist so the static host doesn't
404 before admin.js gets a chance to run.

Per-product pages (/admin/products/<slug>/) mirror the storefront's
/product/<slug>/ pattern, fetching slugs from the same public REST
endpoint gen-product-pages.py uses. Everything else that isn't a
top-level section (a specific order, a reseller, the unreleased-files
drawer) intentionally has no static file - IDs there are unbounded, and
admin.js's router falls back to that state's parent list on a direct hit.

Usage:  python3 gen-admin-pages.py
Run it (alongside gen-product-pages.py) after adding, renaming or
retiring a product, and commit the result.
