// Shared by get-download-url and admin-get-download-url.
//
// Two things the raw createSignedUrl() result gets wrong for a buyer:
//
//  1. The filename. Stored objects are named
//     "<slug>/files/<8-hex>-<original>.zip", so the browser saves the uuid
//     prefix as part of the name. `download` sets Content-Disposition on the
//     response, which is what the Save dialog actually reads.
//
//  2. The host. Signed URLs are built from the SUPABASE_URL that Supabase
//     injects into every function, which is always the project-ref origin
//     (<ref>.supabase.co) even when a custom domain is configured - so the
//     download prompt says "ekinmytmudjwfaqaqswp.supabase.co", which reads
//     as a phishing link to anyone who just paid us. Setting
//     PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL re-hosts the signed URL onto that origin. The
//     signature covers the path and query, not the host, so swapping the
//     origin does not invalidate it.
//
//     This is only half the fix: PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL must point at a domain
//     that actually terminates to this Supabase project (the Custom Domains
//     add-on, or a reverse proxy). Until one exists, leave it unset and the
//     URL is returned untouched rather than pointed at a host that 404s.
