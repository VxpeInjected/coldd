// Deploy with:
//   supabase functions deploy verify-robux-order
//
// Confirms a Robux order after the buyer says they've bought the gamepass.
//
// POOL MODEL. The order was served ONE pooled pass, priced to its exact total,
// leased for a fixed window. Proving payment therefore means proving a SALE of
// that pass, for that amount, after that lease began.
//
// Inventory ownership is deliberately no longer used. Pooled passes are reused
// across buyers and orders, and gamepass ownership is permanent - so a buyer who
// legitimately paid for a pass last week still owns it forever, and an ownership
// check would hand them every later order that happened to draw the same pass,
// for free. That is not a hardening detail; it is the reason the old approach
// cannot survive pooling.
//
// Consequence worth knowing: the group sale ledger (ROBLOX_FALLBACK_COOKIE) is
// now REQUIRED, not a fallback. Without it there is no safe way to confirm a
// pooled purchase, so verification fails closed and the order waits for the
// admin override in the Orders panel rather than being auto-confirmed.
//
